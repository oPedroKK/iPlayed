# iPlayed - A Simple Game Display Website

Originally, I intended to create a simple list of games I plan to play. However, during the development process, I shifted my focus towards building a gaming marketplace-style website. Eventually, I decided to return to my initial concept.

Currently, this project combines elements from both ideas, blending the simplicity of a personal game list with some features inspired by a marketplace.
